RenderFUN

The goal of this project is to make a simple Vulkan renderer with flutter (and Qt for comparison) UI.This can be then used as a template for my future apps.

I'm making this to gain some practical knowledge of how to make:
- Vulkan to draw simple stuff on screen
- UI that can be used on different platforms/screens
- Application deployment on Linux (AppImage and Canonical snaps)
